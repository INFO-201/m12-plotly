# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice using the [Plotly API](https://plot.ly/r/) to build an interactive map in R, and getting it up and running on a website using a `gh-pages` branch (for more infor on this, see [module-11](https://github.com/INFO-201/m11-r-markdown)).

Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

- As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository.
- Create an new R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file in this project called `index.Rmd` (so that we can easily create a website)
- Using the available documentation, create a chart of your choice, and [add annotations](https://plot.ly/r/text-and-annotations/) using Plotly (in a **code block**)
- Write a short paragraph, and then show your plot in your Markdown file
- Knit your HTML file
- Add and commit your changes to Git (on your terminal)
- Create a `gh-pages` branch of your work
- Push your `gh-pages` branch up to GitHub
- View your new interactive website at `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/m12-plotly/exercise-2`
